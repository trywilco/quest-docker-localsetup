title: Setting up your local environment with Anythink
description: |-
  It’s time to set up your development environment.
  Your manager will help you set up Docker locally, which will make it much easier to run our system and all its dependencies.
actionurl: "/chat"
hints:
- Read through the Docker installation guide thoroughly and make sure you didn't miss
  any steps.
- If you've already installed Docker on your machine, open the application and follow
  the Quick Start Guide. To run the Quick Start Guide on demand, select the Docker
  menu and then choose Quick Start Guide.
- Make sure you ran the \`docker-compose up\` command from the **project root directory**
  and that it finished running. This may take a few moments.
