description: "Itâ€™s time to set things up!\nThis quest is so straightforward we really couldâ€™ve gone with just the first sentence, but that wouldnâ€™t have looked good visually, so here's a bit more text. Yes, now it's the perfect length. Anyway, go do the quest. Your adventure begins now!"
summary: "Thatâ€™s it; youâ€™re now officially part of ${companyName} and have everything you need: Snack to communicate with your co-workers and Github repository to access the system that weâ€™re going to work on.\nWe hope youâ€™re excited as we are and ready to start your Wilco journey!"
