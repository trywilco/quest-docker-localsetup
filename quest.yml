title: Setup
description: Your tools are lying before you; it’s time to see if they’re sharp and
  ready for work. We’ll set up a local environment, verify that its backend and frontend
  are connected and create a test user.
summary: |-
  That's all for now, The system is working locally, and you have everything you need to continue. We hope the Docker setup helped make it easier to set everything up without installing and configuring many parts.
