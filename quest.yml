title: Setup
description: Your tools are lying before you; it’s time to see if they’re sharp and
  ready for work. We’ll set up a local environment, verify that its backend and frontend
  are connected, create a test user, and make sure that the generations of engineers
  who follow in our footsteps understand how valuable our contribution to their success
  was—through proper documentation of our efforts.
summary: |-
  That's all for now, The system is working locally, and you have everything you need to continue. We hope the Docker setup helped make it easier to set everything up without installing and configuring many parts.

  Also, this quest showed us how important it is to have documentation, even (and maybe especially) on day one. Perhaps you can use this opportunity to look at a readme of your team’s project or an open-source one and see if there’s something you can improve.
slogan: Does it work on your machine?
